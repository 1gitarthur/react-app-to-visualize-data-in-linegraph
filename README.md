## Line Graph Visualization in React
This project demonstrates how to create a line graph visualization using React and Chart.js. It is a simple example that can be easily customized to fit your specific needs.

### Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (the Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/line-graph-react.git
cd line-graph-react
npm install
```
#### Usage
The LineGraph component takes in an array of data objects, where each object has a label and a value property. The label property is used for the x-axis and the value property is used for the y-axis.

Here's an example of how you can use the LineGraph component in another component:
```
import LineGraph from './LineGraph';

const data = [
  { label: 'January', value: 100 },
  { label: 'February', value: 200 },
  { label: 'March', value: 300 },
  // ...
];

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <LineGraph data={data} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
#### Customizing the Line Graph
The LineGraph component is built using the Line component from react-chartjs-2 and the Chart.js library. You can find the documentation for react-chartjs-2 here: https://github.com/jerairrest/react-chartjs-2 and for Chart.js here: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/.

You can customize the line graph by passing options to the Line component. For example, you can change the title of the graph, the colors, and the scales.
```
const options = {
  responsive: true,
  title: { text: 'My Custom Title', display: true },
  scales: {
    yAxes: [
      {
        ticks: {
          beginAtZero: true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

return (
  <div>
    <Line
      data={chartData}
      options={options}
    />
  </div>
);
```
#### Development
To start a development server, run the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will start a development server on http://localhost:8080/ and you can see the changes you make in the browser.

#### Production
To build the project for production, run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a dist folder in the root directory of the project, which contains the optimized code for production.

#### Conclusion
This project is a simple example of how to create a line graph visualization in React. You can easily customize it to fit your specific needs and requirements. You can also play around with different options and styles provided by react-chartjs-2 and Chart.js library.
